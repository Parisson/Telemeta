Overview
=========

Telemeta is a free and open source web audio archiving software which introduces useful and secure methods to backup, index, transcode, analyse and publish any digitalized audio file with extensive metadata. It is dedicated to collaborative media archiving projects, research laboratories and digital humanities - and especially in ethnomusicological use cases - who wants to easily organize, backup and publish documented sound collections of audio files, CDs, digitalized vinyls and magnetic tapes over a strong database, in accordance with open web standards.

Key features:

* Secure archiving, editing and publishing of audio files over internet.
* Pure HTML web user interface including dynamical forms and smart workflows
* Smart dynamical and skinnable audio player (thanks to  TimeSide and  SoundManager2)
* "On the fly" audio analyzing, transcoding and metadata embedding based on an easy plugin architecture
* Social cumulative indexing with semantic ontologies and timecoded markers
* Multi-format support : FLAC, OGG, MP3, WAV and more
* User management with individual desk, lists, profiles and rights
* Playlist management for all users with CSV data export
* Geo-Navigator for audio geolocalization
* High level search engine
* DublinCore compatibility
* OAI-PMH data provider
* RSS feed generators
* XML and ZIP serialized backups
* SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL or Oracle DB backends
* Multi-language support (now english and french)
* Video support (EXPERIMENTAL, WebM only)

This web audio CMS is exclusively based on open source modules and can be run on any Unix or Linux system.
It is mostly written in Python and JavaScript.

The processing engine of Telemeta is a separate project called `TimeSide <https://github.com/yomguy/timeside/>`_ as an open web audio pocessing framework written in Python.

Install
=======

Thanks to Docker, Telemeta is now fully available as a docker image ready to work. The docker based composition bundles some powerfull applications and modern frameworks out-of-the-box like: Python, Numpy, Gstreamer, Django, Celery, Haystack, ElasticSearch, MySQL, RabbitMQ, uWSGI, Nginx and many more...

First install `Git <http://git-scm.com/downloads>`_, `Docker <https://docs.docker.com/installation/>`_ and `docker-compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/>`_, then run these commands in a terminal::

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/Parisson/Telemeta.git
    cd Telemeta
    docker-compose up

You can now browse http://localhost:8000


Restore / backup
================

To restore a backuped database, put your backup file in data/backup, then in another terminal::

    docker-compose run db /srv/backup/restore_db.sh FILENAME

where FILENAME is the backup filename (can be .sql or .sql.gz)

To backup the database, just run in another terminal::

    docker-compose run db /srv/backup/backup_db.sh
